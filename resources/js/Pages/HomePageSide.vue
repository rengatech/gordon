            <p class="mt-5 text-lg">The Holy Land is an area roughly located between the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern bank of the Jordan
                River, traditionally synonymous both with the biblical Land of Israel and with the region of Palestine.
                Today, the term "Holy Land" usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern State of
                Israel and the State of Palestine. Jews, Christians, Muslims and Baháʼís regard it as holy.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-5 text-lg">
                Part of the significance of the land stems from the religious significance of Jerusalem (the holiest
                city to Judaism, and the location of the First and Second Temples), as well as its historical
                significance as the setting for most of the Bible, the historical locale of Jesus' ministry, the
                location of the first Qibla before Kaaba in Mecca and the site of the Isra and Mi'raj event in Islam,
                and the site of the most revered pilgrimage sites in the Baháʼí faith.</p>
